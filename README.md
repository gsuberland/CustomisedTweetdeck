# Customised Tweetdeck

This repo contains a bunch of CSS and JS hacks I use with Tweetdeck:

* **Wider columns** - Expands columns for better for reading on a 4K monitor.
* **Centered columns** - Personal preference; I don't like reading the main feed way over on the left.
* **Message privacy** - Blurs text in the messages column until you hover your mouse over it.
* **Taller media previews** - Makes media cards in the feed 375px tall instead of default ~200px.
* **Bigger tweet footer** - Makes the like/RT buttons and counts slightly larger.
* **Preview resolution enhancer** - Increases the in-feed preview image resolution from 360x360 to 900x900.

Styles are applied with Stylus, scripts are applied with Greasemonkey. Both should be easily hackable.

Tested on Firefox only. Styles should work fine on any browser, but scripts may not work on Chrome or other browsers - YMMV.
